# Specification: Google Earth-Powered Virtual Travel Preview

## Overview
The goal of this feature is to create an immersive, interactive virtual travel preview using Google Earth’s 3D mapping capabilities. Users will experience a dynamic flyover journey from their departure city to their destination, including key highlights such as their hotel, landmarks, planned activities, and transportation routes. This will enhance travel planning by making it visually engaging and personalized.

### Feature Description
The virtual travel preview will:
- **Fly into the destination city** from the user’s departure location with a cinematic 3D animation.
- **Zoom into key locations** (e.g., hotel, landmarks) with smooth flyovers.
- **Showcase planned activities** with virtual tours of attractions.
- **Highlight transportation routes** (e.g., metro lines, taxi routes, car rental locations).
- **Fly out of the city** to conclude the experience.

### Target Use Case
- Travel planning apps or websites looking to differentiate with an immersive preview.
- Users who want a visual, interactive way to explore their itinerary before booking or traveling.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Fly-In Animation
- **Input:** User’s departure city (e.g., "New York") and destination city (e.g., "Paris").
- **Output:** A 3D flyover animation starting from a high-altitude view of the departure city, traveling across the globe, and descending into the destination city.
- **Details:** Smooth transitions with realistic curvature of the Earth, using satellite imagery and 3D terrain data.

### 2. Zoom into Hotel & Landmarks
- **Input:** Hotel address and a list of landmarks (e.g., Eiffel Tower, Louvre).
- **Output:** A 3D flyover zooming into the hotel location and then panning to each landmark with labeled overlays.
- **Details:** Include a subtle hover effect or tooltip with the name and a brief description of each location.

### 3. Virtual Tours of Activities
- **Input:** List of planned activities (e.g., "Louvre Museum Tour," "Seine River Cruise") with associated locations.
- **Output:** Short virtual tour clips or 3D flyovers of each activity location, potentially with pre-rendered animations or interactive 360° views.
- **Details:** Overlay activity names and times from the itinerary.

### 4. Transportation Routes
- **Input:** Transportation options (e.g., metro stations, taxi stands, rental car locations) and routes between itinerary points.
- **Output:** Animated lines or paths overlaid on the 3D map showing how to get from the hotel to landmarks/activities.
- **Details:** Color-code routes by mode (e.g., blue for metro, yellow for taxis) and include estimated travel times.

### 5. Fly-Out Animation
- **Input:** Destination city.
- **Output:** A cinematic fly-out from the destination city, ascending to a high-altitude view and fading to a "Trip Complete" screen.
- **Details:** Mirror the fly-in animation for symmetry and closure.

### 6. Personalization
- **Input:** User preferences (e.g., preferred landmarks, travel pace, transportation mode).
- **Output:** Adjusted flyover routes, highlighted locations, and activity suggestions based on preferences.
- **Details:** Allow users to tweak the preview via a settings panel (e.g., "Skip fly-in," "Focus on culture").

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Mapping & Animation Engine
- **Option A: Google Earth Studio**
  - Use Google Earth Studio for pre-rendered cinematic animations.
  - Export animations as video files and stitch them dynamically based on user inputs.
  - Pros: High-quality visuals, easy to use.
  - Cons: Less interactive, requires video processing.
- **Option B: CesiumJS**
  - Use CesiumJS for real-time, interactive 3D globe rendering.
  - Build custom flyover paths and overlays programmatically.
  - Pros: Fully interactive, customizable.
  - Cons: Steeper learning curve, heavier client-side processing.
- **Recommendation:** Start with CesiumJS for flexibility and interactivity, falling back to Google Earth Studio if performance becomes an issue.

### 2. APIs & Data Sources
- **Google Earth API (or CesiumJS equivalent):** For 3D globe rendering and terrain data.
- **Geocoding API (e.g., Google Maps):** Convert user inputs (e.g., "Paris") into coordinates.
- **Itinerary Data:** Sync with an external itinerary source (e.g., JSON file or API) containing flight details, hotel address, and activity list.
- **Transportation API (e.g., Google Directions API):** Fetch routes and travel times between locations.

### 3. UI/UX
- **Platform:** Embeddable in a web app (React/Vue) or mobile app (React Native/Flutter).
- **Controls:**
  - Play/Pause button for the animation.
  - Skip-to-section options (e.g., "Jump to Hotel").
  - Fullscreen toggle.
- **Styling:** Clean, modern overlay with minimalistic labels and tooltips.

### 4. Performance
- Optimize for smooth rendering on mid-range devices (e.g., 60 FPS animations).
- Cache map tiles and pre-rendered animations where possible.
- Fallback to 2D maps or static images if 3D rendering fails.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Setup & Core Mapping
1. **Choose Mapping Tool:** Set up CesiumJS (or Google Earth Studio) in the project environment.
2. **Basic Flyover:** Build a simple fly-in animation from one hardcoded city to another (e.g., New York to Paris).
3. **UI Integration:** Embed the map viewer in a web/mobile app skeleton with basic controls (play/pause).

### Phase 2: Itinerary Integration
1. **Input Parsing:** Create a function to parse itinerary data (e.g., JSON with departure, hotel, landmarks).
2. **Dynamic Flyovers:** Adjust the flyover path and zoom-ins based on parsed coordinates.
3. **Overlays:** Add labels and tooltips for hotels and landmarks.

### Phase 3: Activities & Transportation
1. **Activity Tours:** Integrate virtual tour snippets or 3D flyovers for each activity location.
2. **Route Visualization:** Overlay transportation routes using API data (e.g., metro lines, taxi paths).
3. **Polish:** Smooth transitions between sections with fade effects.

### Phase 4: Personalization & Polish
1. **User Preferences:** Add a settings panel for tweaking the preview (e.g., skip sections, preferred transport).
2. **Fly-Out:** Implement the fly-out animation to mirror the fly-in.
3. **Testing:** Ensure compatibility across devices (desktop, mobile) and optimize performance.

## Deliverables
- **Frontend Component:** A reusable map preview module (e.g., React component) that accepts itinerary data as props.
- **Backend API (Optional):** A service to fetch and preprocess itinerary/transportation data if not provided by the client.
- **Documentation:** Usage guide for integrating the feature into an existing app, including sample itinerary JSON format.

## Timeline (Estimated)
- **Phase 1:** 1-2 weeks (setup and basic flyover).
- **Phase 2:** 2-3 weeks (itinerary integration and overlays).
- **Phase 3:** 2-3 weeks (activities and transportation).
- **Phase 4:** 1-2 weeks (personalization and polish).
- **Total:** 6-10 weeks, depending on team size and complexity.

## Success Criteria
- The preview runs smoothly on modern browsers/devices with no noticeable lag.
- Users can input their itinerary and see a tailored, immersive flyover experience.
- The feature feels intuitive and enhances the travel planning process.

## Potential Enhancements
- **AR Integration:** Overlay the preview on a real-world view using mobile AR.
- **Weather Effects:** Simulate destination weather (e.g., rain, sunshine) during the flyover.
- **Social Sharing:** Export the preview as a shareable video or link.
