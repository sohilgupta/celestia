# Specification: Celestia - Google Earth-Powered Virtual Travel Preview

## Overview
**Celestia** is an immersive, Google Earth-powered virtual travel preview that lets users experience their trip in 3D before they go—and relive it afterward. Fly from your departure city to your destination, zoom into hotels and landmarks, explore planned activities, and trace transportation routes, all in a cinematic journey. Post-trip, Celestia transforms into a personal highlight reel, mapping your best photos, videos, and memories with music.

### Feature Description
**Celestia** will:
- **Fly into the destination city** from your departure location with a stellar 3D animation.
- **Zoom into key locations** (hotel, landmarks) with smooth, cosmic flyovers.
- **Showcase planned activities** with virtual tours of attractions.
- **Highlight transportation routes** (metro, taxis, rentals) in orbit-like paths.
- **Fly out of the city** to conclude the pre-trip preview.
- **Post-Trip Highlight Reel (Later Feature):** Overlay your best photos, videos, and trip highlights on the map, synced to uplifting music.

### Tagline
"Your Travel Universe Awaits"

### Target Use Case
- Travel apps/websites aiming to make planning and reminiscing immersive and unforgettable.
- Users who crave a visual, starlit journey through their itinerary—before and after travel.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Mapping & Animation Engine
- **CesiumJS (Primary):** Real-time 3D globe rendering for the **Celestia Viewer**.
- **Google Earth Studio (Fallback):** Pre-rendered animations if interactivity isn’t needed.
- **Recommendation:** CesiumJS for flexibility and the post-trip reel’s dynamic overlays.

### 2. APIs & Data Sources
- **Google Earth API/CesiumJS:** 3D rendering and terrain data.
- **Geocoding API:** Convert addresses to coordinates.
- **Itinerary Data:** JSON or API with flight, hotel, and activity details.
- **Transportation API:** Routes and times (e.g., Google Directions).
- **Media Handling:** Client-side upload for photos/videos in the highlight reel.

### 3. UI/UX
- **Platform:** Web app (React/Vue) or mobile (React Native/Flutter).
- **Controls:**
  - Play/Pause for animations and highlight reel.
  - Skip-to-section (e.g., "Jump to Landmarks").
  - Fullscreen toggle.
  - Post-trip: Upload button and music selector.
- **Styling:** Cosmic-inspired overlays (e.g., glowing labels, starry transitions).

### 4. Performance
